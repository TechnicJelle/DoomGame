# DoomGame
Doom-ish clone made in the Saxion GXP Engine

# âš  Further Updates!
Because the GXP Engine was really not meant for this kind of stuff, the development of new features is pretty difficult, so I am planning on rewriting this whole game in C++ using the [PixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine). \
I'll still implement the last three items on the [TODO](https://github.com/TechnicJelle/DoomGameGXP/projects/1?fullscreen=true) (Wall warping & Enemy interaction), but after that I'll start the other project, which I'll link to down below here once it's ready.



## Progress GIFs
### The fix for the texture warping!!

### The switch to a horror game

### Textured walls, now sorted correctly!

Also visible in this GIF are the textures on the minimap and the hot-reloading from Tiled level files!

## Really outdated GIFs
### Blank walls, all perfect sorting

(Also contains a small bit of flickering sides, but I'm hoping that once I've implemented DDA, that that'll go away)

### Textured walls, with still wrong sorting
